# EDA-Covid-dataset
Analysing the covid dataset and using the python libraries to derive insights
## PROBLEM STATEMENT: The Department of Health & Family Welfare(Govt. of India) has to put out a report showing the numbers regarding the spread of covid in India and the vaccination drive undertaken by the Govt. of India. The report should also answer a list of questions which has to be submitted to the Prime Ministers Office.  

 1. Number of active cases
 2. Statewise Mortality and Recovery rates
 3. States with maximum no. of active cases
 4. States with minimum no. of active cases
 5. Growth trend in 5 states with maximum active users.
 6. Male vs Female vaccination
 7. Top 5 most vaccinated states
 8. Top 5 least vaccinated states

 ## DATASETS USED IS FROM 2020-2021: covid_19_india, covid_vaccine_statewise

### In this project we use Python Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the covid infection and vaccination data all across the country, of all states to derive required insights and answer the above mentioned questions.

### Topics covered in this project are :

  1. Data Exctraction
  2. Data Cleaning and Prepartion
  3. Data Manipulation and Transformation
  4. Data Exploration and Analysis
  5. Data Visualization
  6. Insight Derivation
To perform the aforementioned activities on our data we will be taking the help of the following Python tools:

  1. Python Pandas
  2. Python Numpy
  3. Python Matplotlib
  4. Python Seaborn

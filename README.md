# EDA-Covid-dataset
Analysing the covid dataset and using the python libraries to derive insights
## PROBLEM STATEMENT: The Department of Health & Family Welfare(Govt. of India) has to put out a report showing the numbers regarding the spread of covid in India and the vaccination drive undertaken by the Govt. of India. The report should also answer a list of questions which has to be submitted to the Prime Ministers Office.  

  1. Which are the top 10 states having highest number of confirmed cases of covid?
  2. Which States had the highest number of deaths due to covid?
  3. Which states had the highest Mortality Rates ?
  4. Which states had the highest Recovery Rates?
  5. How was the trend of covid spread in the top 5 most affected states? When did these states achieve their respective peaks?
  6. How was the pan India trend of covid spread?
  7. Which brand of vaccine has been administered the most and what is the brand wise distribution of the total vaccine doses administered?
  8. How was the gender wise distribution of the vaccine across India?
  9. Which are the top 10 states having the highest number of doses administered to their citizens?
  10.How was the vaccination trend in the top 5 most vaccinated states (acc to number of doses administered)?
  11.Which are top 10 states with most number of individuals vaccinated?
  12.Which are top 10 states with least number of individuals vaccinated?
  13.Insights from your analysis will be used by the government to formulate new policies and take data-driven decisions to mitigate the effects of covid . You must be    able to back your insights using data and give a detailed explanation for your findings.

 ## DATASETS USED IS FROM 2020-2021: covid_19_india, covid_vaccine_statewise

### In this project we use Python Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the covid infection and vaccination data all across the country, of all states to derive required insights and answer the above mentioned questions.

### Topics covered in this project are :

  1. Data Exctraction
  2. Data Cleaning and Prepartion
  3. Data Manipulation and Transformation
  4. Data Exploration and Analysis
  5. Data Visualization
  6. Insight Derivation
To perform the aforementioned activities on our data we will be taking the help of the following Python tools:

  1. Python Pandas
  2. Python Numpy
  3. Python Matplotlib
  4. Python Seaborn
